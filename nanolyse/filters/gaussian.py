    Filters input signal using a gaussian filer and a user defined cut-off frequency.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : numpy array
        The signal should be fed as a array of arrays.
        Each top-level array is treated as a trace of a signal allowing easy cross-trace analysis (for e.g. current dependent analysis).
    sampling_period : float
        The sampling_frequency is used in combination with the dwelltime argument exclude short events.
    Fs : int
        The cut-off frequency in hertz
    
    Returns
    -------
    Numpy array
        Returns a numpy array, equal dimensions as the input signal
